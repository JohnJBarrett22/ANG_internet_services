        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Amazing....but see story below.<br><br>This was initially very ironic. They are located in CA and I am in NC. 3,500 miles apart.<br><br>I needed network help asap. I had a new modem and equipment put in the house as a <strong>repair</strong>. This led to everything no longer being networked. When we realized this was not going to be a house call....I had suggested to end the consult. But Andrei said if I was willing to take the time to help him...we likely could do it remote and help.<br><br>He not only fixed the problem of multiple <strong>computers</strong> and TVs and printers not talking...but he streamlined my network to work more efficiently than before.<br><br>Thank you!!I now have my own virtual IT guy.&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Andres responded quickly to my task. He was able to meet me on the weekend. My <strong>computer</strong> had been freezing and shutting off randomly. He went through things step by step to diagnose the problem. When it turned out we needed to order some parts, he helped me order them at a discount. He also reached out to me afterwards to make sure things were working okay. Would definitely hire again.&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;From <strong>computers</strong> to WiFi systems, he knows it all. I consider myself to be pretty tech savvy but he completely blew me away with his 25 years of experience. Andrei took my <strong>computer</strong>, fixed it, saved all of my data and had it back to me in less than 24 hours. Diagnosed our WiFi issue in 20 minutes and had it fixed the next day. Extremely hard worker, and very respectful. Gives his real and honest technological suggestions.

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I had never used a service like Thumbtack before and was very nervous to need a home visit tech during quarantine. Andrei was fantastic! He answered my request so quickly, made plans to come straight over, and was an absolute lifesaver. I had a social distanced <strong>computer</strong> situation set up outside - and Andrei was so respectful of Covid Safety concerns. He took his time, figured out what had happened (some crazy Catalina update issue) and kindly explained everything to me. He checked in with me after his service that night to follow up. When another related issue arose the next day (he warned me this could possibly happen) he spent 2 hours with me via screen share to fix the next issue - charging me extremely fairly. Andrei is my new go-to guy! I can&#x27;t recommend him enough!&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Andrei did a great job installing a WiFi mesh system in a large house with separate buildings. We have had WiFi problems for a while and had difficulty solving the issue. Andrei was responsive, knowledgeable. He patiently answered all of our questions and offered a solution that was both economical and met our needs. He did a great job and I will continue to engage his services if/when the need arises. I would recommend him without reservation.&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Andrei was so polite and kind from the very beginning. He gave me options and suggested actions to take before he came out to my house. Once I decided I did need him to come over, he assessed my place, called my internet provider, took down unnecessary cables I had inherited, and gave me a full explanation of my new home&#x27;s set up. He was thorough, calm, and incredibly helpful. I wish everyone in customer service would be like Andrei because it is a pleasure to do business with small businesses.<br><br>Thank you, Andrei!&quot;</p>

Not only did he get our <strong>computer</strong> fixed fast he also took the time to answer questions about my sons gaming <strong>computer</strong>. He gave me options. He could have easily taken the job to upgrade the one I had but he instead directed me to purchase a new one. Rarely do you find honest people like this. In addition he told me to call anytime should I have questions. I wish I could give him 6 stars. A total pro. I so much appreciate this during these times. Thanks Andrei!&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Andrei was one of the best people I have worked with in business. I am a small business owner and have seen many service providers come and go due to either not being qualified to do the work, or not showing genuine interest to solving our issues.<br><br>Andrei is the complete opposite. He was very open to listening to the IT issues I was having at work. The issues were a bit complex (in my opinion--I&#x27;m not an IT person) and actually required two previous IT people and one AT&amp;T service tech. None of these people could figure out what was going on.<br><br>Andrei came to the rescue on a Saturday night at 7 pm just after another IT person I hired said he needed to do more research about my problem. Andrei was very professional, calm, and able to jump right in to get to the root of our IT issues. After working on our problem for about 3 hours, it is finally resolved, and I think it will be for good. Andrei provided concrete reasons why I was having issues in the first place, and also gave me some really good recommendations to prevent something like this from happening in the future. Additionally, he called in the morning and texted me in the afternoon to make sure our system was running smoothly.<br><br>I would highly recommend his services to any personal or business client who wants to deal with a professional, proficient, and caring person! His services won&#x27;t be the cheapest you will find, but sometimes it&#x27;s worth to pay the money for a real expert.&quot;</p>
