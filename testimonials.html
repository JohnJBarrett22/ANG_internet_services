        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Amazing....but see story below.<br><br>This was initially very ironic. They are located in CA and I am in NC. 3,500 miles apart.<br><br>I needed network help asap. I had a new modem and equipment put in the house as a <strong>repair</strong>. This led to everything no longer being networked. When we realized this was not going to be a house call....I had suggested to end the consult. But Andrei said if I was willing to take the time to help him...we likely could do it remote and help.<br><br>He not only fixed the problem of multiple <strong>computers</strong> and TVs and printers not talking...but he streamlined my network to work more efficiently than before.<br><br>Thank you!!I now have my own virtual IT guy.&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Andres responded quickly to my task. He was able to meet me on the weekend. My <strong>computer</strong> had been freezing and shutting off randomly. He went through things step by step to diagnose the problem. When it turned out we needed to order some parts, he helped me order them at a discount. He also reached out to me afterwards to make sure things were working okay. Would definitely hire again.&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;From <strong>computers</strong> to WiFi systems, he knows it all. I consider myself to be pretty tech savvy but he completely blew me away with his 25 years of experience. Andrei took my <strong>computer</strong>, fixed it, saved all of my data and had it back to me in less than 24 hours. Diagnosed our WiFi issue in 20 minutes and had it fixed the next day. Extremely hard worker, and very respectful. Gives his real and honest technological suggestions.

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;We are a church that has been around for 100 years. Andrei came in, walked the campus. Accessed our situation, said it was very doable. Finished all the work before the deadline and has continued to check on how things are doing. Very respectful, always backs up his work, and always makes himself available if we have questions.

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I had never used a service like Thumbtack before and was very nervous to need a home visit tech during quarantine. Andrei was fantastic! He answered my request so quickly, made plans to come straight over, and was an absolute lifesaver. I had a social distanced <strong>computer</strong> situation set up outside - and Andrei was so respectful of Covid Safety concerns. He took his time, figured out what had happened (some crazy Catalina update issue) and kindly explained everything to me. He checked in with me after his service that night to follow up. When another related issue arose the next day (he warned me this could possibly happen) he spent 2 hours with me via screen share to fix the next issue - charging me extremely fairly. Andrei is my new go-to guy! I can&#x27;t recommend him enough!&quot;</p>

We have had WiFi problems for a while and had difficulty solving the issue. Andrei was responsive, knowledgeable.

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Andrei was so polite and kind from the very beginning. He gave me options and suggested actions to take before he came out to my house. Once I decided I did need him to come over, he assessed my place, called my internet provider, took down unnecessary cables I had inherited, and gave me a full explanation of my new home&#x27;s set up. He was thorough, calm, and incredibly helpful. I wish everyone in customer service would be like Andrei because it is a pleasure to do business with small businesses.<br><br>Thank you, Andrei!&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Wow. Wow. Wow. All I can say is thank you. Not only did he get our <strong>computer</strong> fixed fast he also took the time to answer questions about my sons gaming <strong>computer</strong>. He gave me options. He could have easily taken the job to upgrade the one I had but he instead directed me to purchase a new one. Rarely do you find honest people like this. In addition he told me to call anytime should I have questions. I wish I could give him 6 stars. A total pro. I so much appreciate this during these times. Thanks Andrei!&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Andre was FANTASTIC, very exact &amp; knowledgeable. He proved me WRONG because I was SKEPTICAL of him fixing it. He fixed it in 1/2 hr and got my TAX Program working cause it had a conflict with Windows updates. 2 others tried but FAILED to fix it, including the Tax Software Co who tried for 3 hrs.....lol<br><br>I will tell them tomorrow how Andre fixed it in 1/2 remotely. He would have Even come out to my home IF he could not fix it remotely. DON&#x27;T GO ANYWHERE ELSE AS HE&#x27;S FANTASTIC AND WILL FIX YOUR PROBLEM.&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;A&amp;G was awesome. I hired Adrei to create a PDF for me, for which he quoted me for 3 hours of his time. What I wanted was complex and very detailed much more than I realized. Andrei was so patient and professional. He created exactly what I wanted. He spent at minimum 7 hours on the project. When I offered to pay him more. Andrei would not accept more money. His response was I quoted you 3 hours and I honor my quote. I was so happy and surprised of the final project.&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Andrei was one of the best people I have worked with in business. I am a small business owner and have seen many service providers come and go due to either not being qualified to do the work, or not showing genuine interest to solving our issues.<br><br>Andrei is the complete opposite. He was very open to listening to the IT issues I was having at work. The issues were a bit complex (in my opinion--I&#x27;m not an IT person) and actually required two previous IT people and one AT&amp;T service tech. None of these people could figure out what was going on.<br><br>Andrei came to the rescue on a Saturday night at 7 pm just after another IT person I hired said he needed to do more research about my problem. Andrei was very professional, calm, and able to jump right in to get to the root of our IT issues. After working on our problem for about 3 hours, it is finally resolved, and I think it will be for good. Andrei provided concrete reasons why I was having issues in the first place, and also gave me some really good recommendations to prevent something like this from happening in the future. Additionally, he called in the morning and texted me in the afternoon to make sure our system was running smoothly.<br><br>I would highly recommend his services to any personal or business client who wants to deal with a professional, proficient, and caring person! His services won&#x27;t be the cheapest you will find, but sometimes it&#x27;s worth to pay the money for a real expert.&quot;</p>

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Wonderful and stunningly effective! ¬†I am so happy and grateful to have met Dr. Jay Ryu L. Ac., Ph. D., and to have been treated by him. ¬† We first met 3 years ago, and this year after some time away, I came to him with a seemingly intractable medical problem. ¬†In a very short course of treatment, Dr. Ryu eliminated persistent abdominal dysfunction and severe pains, pains that had deeply distressed me and completely stumped western-medicine doctors for 9 months.<br><br>I started having sharp abdominal pains late last Winter, sometimes rolling on the floor in discomfort, and they persisted every day through the Spring, Summer and Fall. ¬†I am a man who can put up with a lot, but I was so frightened by what I experienced that early on I took an emergency air ticket home just so I could get immediate medical treatment. ¬†Over the months, I was seen by 7 different western-medicine doctors, whom I liked and whom I found to be generally good physicians. ¬†Two of my closest friends are General Practitioners, and they helpfully guided me in finding the best doctors. ¬†Despite extensive and increasingly costly scans and tests and a battery of prescription medicine, none of the doctors or their treatments could do anything for me, or the relentless pain, despite their best intentions. ¬†With ever-more-sophisticated scans, probes and drug treatments in store for me, I found myself able to be seen by Dr. Ryu in Los Angeles (Burbank) again. ¬†I wish I&#x27;d seen him much earlier!<br><br>I was stunned and delighted by the wonderful results I experienced with Dr. Ryu - right afterwards I discovered myself laughing with relief. ¬†After one intensive session of acupuncture (for me, I couldn&#x27;t care less about acupuncture needles or what to me is their tiny discomfort), the pains I&#x27;d lived with every day for three-quarters of a year subsided dramatically. ¬†After a day or two, I was still wary, doubting that the success could last - but it did! ¬†I came back for a bit more treatment just to be sure, as I had been considering cancelling upcoming travel just out of fear I&#x27;d be stuck with these pains and end up having to seek treatment overseas. ¬†After Dr. Ryu&#x27;s successful acupuncture my plans are &#x27;on&#x27; and I often find myself forgetting I ever had the abdominal pains that just recently had driven me to distraction.<br><br>I found Dr. Ryu pleasant, highly attentive and willing to help. ¬†I also found him pleasant and humorous, but your mileage may vary. ¬†I suppose that it helped that I came with a &quot;good attitude&quot; as I&#x27;d met him before and had confidence in him. ¬†I&#x27;m not a complainer in general and feel it&#x27;s in my own interest, while keeping my head about me, to cooperate with medical professionals so as to work as a &quot;team&quot; with them. ¬†For sure, other problems may require more extensive treatment, depending on the nature of each one; for an unrelated problem, now that I have the abdominal pains out of the way, I plan to start on a course of Dr. Ryu&#x27;s very-high-quality herbs. ¬†His questions and diagnosis are clearly driven by his intelligence, and by his genuine desire to achieve success for the patient. ¬†Over the years I have experienced medical professionals of every stripe and credo, including some dear favorites of mine, but Dr. Ryu is &quot;the best&quot; in his field I&#x27;ve encountered. ¬†I consider myself very lucky to have been introduced to him and to have been treated by Dr. Ryu!&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial_1default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this man!!!!! It honestly does not get any better. He is the best doctor I have ever seen and the best acupuncturist that I have ever been to. He soars above the rest. Dr. Ryu is one of the most genuine human beings I have met and he is a doctor in Los Angeles. Go figure. He is so kind and compassionate....and an amazing listener. He wants to help you!!!! He wants to succeed in helping you. That is his goal. Keep in mind that this is acupuncture, so it is not an instant fix, but he will help you get there .... and pretty quick. ¬†I initially went in for back issues that no other doctor in 15 years could or wanted to help with. I was barely able to walk 4 weeks ago. Today, I barely notice an issue. Then came an issue a few weeks ago with emotional stress. ¬†Thank God I had Dr. Ryu on my side. He is helping me more than he even knows. He is so humble. Honestly, he really is not that expensive, despite what some of the other reviews said. What you get from Dr. Ryu in time, knowledge, and compassion is worth a heck of a lot more than what he charges. He is not like the others. It is not about the money. It is about helping out another human being. You would be a fool not to go to Dr. Ryu. I can only say &quot;trust me&quot; on this. You will have no regrets.&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial_1default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;When I initially went to Dr Ryu, I was experiencing extreme fatigue, chronic digestion problems, headaches and very painful period cramps. I knew that going to bed at 8pm and still feeling tired in the morning was not normal for a 31 year old but no doctor could explain why. During a preliminary evaluation, Dr Ryu asked me thorough and detailed questions. I immediately realised that he wanted to understand the whole picture of my health, unlike previous Western doctors I had seen. Through weekly accupuncture and herbal medicine (for a couple of months), I have begun to feel VERY different. I now feel refreshed in the morning after a great night&#x27;s sleep and have energy throughout my day. I no longer have digestion issues; no more bloatedness, diarrhea or constipation. My hair is shinier, my nails stronger. The duration of my periods are shorter and I no longer suffer pain from menstrual cramps. Life feels so good again. ¬†I owe so much to this professional, caring and very talented doctor!&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial_1default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

He took an herbal tea for 4 months and he has not had a attack since taking the herbs. This same friends son had an athletic injury to his knee. He had a medial collateral tear in his right knee. Dr Ryu treated him with acupuncture 2 times a week for 3 weeks.
